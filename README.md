IAH: INTERNET WAR is a futuristic strategy game you can play using a programming language or a computer mouse.

Engage in endless internet battles against AI or other players. Participate in tournaments and stand a chance to win prizes that can change your life.

For programmers seeking a competitive challenge, IAH offers algorithmic multiplayer. In this mode, you cannot use a cursor or controller; your interactions are limited to the API Interface. Create or join competitive clubs, write code solo or collaborate in a group, and use your preferred IDE and programming language to wage highly competitive algorithmic wars.
